      <p class="govuk-body"> To apply to change a hearing date, the application fee is £275. If you’ll be selecting
        multiple applications, this fee may be reduced. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body"> If the hearing date that you want to change is more than 14 days away from the date you
        make this application, you will not need to pay a fee. If you add another application, you’ll still have to pay
        the fee for this additional application. </p>
        <p class="govuk-body"> If the hearing is less than 14 days away, the fee above applies. </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The court may not agree to change the hearing, even if both parties have agreed. </p>
        <p class="govuk-body"  style="margin-bottom: 40px;"> The fee will need to be paid once you’ve created the application. If you’re eligible, you may be able to apply for help with fees. </p>
